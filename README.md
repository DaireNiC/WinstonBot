# Winston Chatbot

### About

Name: Daire Ní Chatháin
ID: G00334757

This is an adaptation of the Eliza AI chat bot coded in [Go](http://golang.org). This bot was created as part of my Data Represenation and Querying Module in GMIT. The code here is adapted from [smallsurething.com](https://www.smallsurething.com/implementing-the-famous-eliza-chatbot-in-python/) and also this example provided by [Ian McLoughlin](https://github.com/data-representation/eliza).

### Eliza


### Winston
Winston is a polite, butler-esque chat bot who only want the best for you. Similar to Eliza he acts as psychotherapist, asking open ended questions, always getting the user to guide the conversation. He has a set of unique greetings and responses in keeping with his character, e.g Winston uses phrases such as "Tally-ho!", "Old chum" and "Salutations!".
